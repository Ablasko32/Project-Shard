Project Shard is a pet project of mine. It is designed to be a simple and user-friendly **GUI interface** for users to interact with their favorite **LLMs localy**.
Currently , it supports [**Ollama models only**](https://ollama.com/search).

The core idea is to provide an **all-in-one** solution that runs **privately** on your **localhost**.

The main focus is on being **FREE**, **OPEN SOURCE**, and **PRIVATE**.
